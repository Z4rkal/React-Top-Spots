This project uses a small express server to serve up a list of 'the 30 top spots to visit in San Diego' built using ReactJS.
You can clone this project to your machine using `git clone "git@github.com:Z4rkal/React-Top-Spots.git"`, and if you have Node Package Manager you can use `npm install` in the project folder to download the dependencies, and then `npm start` to build the project and then launch the server.

The server listens on port 3000, and the page will ask for your location data in order to list the distance to each item from the user's location.
